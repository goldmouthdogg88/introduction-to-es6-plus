/*
  In order to understand why let and const exists, you have to understand varaible hoisting in JavaScript.
  What may surprise you is that we get a null.

  let: is a stricter version of var. In which it uses block scope.

  const: stands for constant, doesn't work in the way you expect

  You can however add attributes to objects and arrays.
